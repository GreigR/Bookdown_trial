#Bookdown trial

This document will be used to build a "book", which will be a single part document in the first instance, leading to a PDF & Word document output

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
